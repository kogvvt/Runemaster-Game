# RuneMaster

## Roguelike game that takes place between us and the realm of Gods.

### Author : Krystian Kogut 

### Technology used : Java

## Why did I chose Java?
I chose it simply because it can run with little to no problems on all systems as long as you have a JVM to run it. Also things like Garbage Collector will help a lot in maintaining stability and prevent memory leaks. Even though Java is considered a mediocre language to program games in, it can still provide decent quality and performance (also personally Java is a language that I want to get better with).

## Game description
The idea of this game is to show the road of a player that is a novice at working with runes to complete rune mastery. He will be put into many dangerous situations so he could learn how to use them flawlessly. Runes will have different meanings and uses, which will become useful later on in the game. Some runes would heal, some would kill. Some would bribe, some would make somebody angry. The only limit is within the player (and the technical capabilities).

## Some mechanics
Runes are associated with magic and illusion, so focusing on those aspects is key.
By implementing different runes that will help the player (runes are small, so the player can collect them all) I could have freedom regarding mechanics, magic, interactions and (maybe) possible synergies. As it is a roguelike, it would have permadeath, no save states (maybe some savefiles but in a progress type of way, we shall see), turn-based gameplay, pokemon-style battles, exploration, and a procedurally generated map based on a grid with some puzzle elements.

## Visuals
I would love to try to make it in nordic, pixel-art style, but I don't know if it will be possible in so little time so that's a subject to change.
