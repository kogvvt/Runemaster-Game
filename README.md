# RuneMaster

## Roguelike game that takes place between us and the realm of Gods.

### Author : Krystian Kogut 

### Technology used : Java

## Due to anti-plagiarism system at my university the code was added to my github portfolio after making and grading it. 

## Why did I chose Java?
I chose it simply because it can run with little to no problems on all systems as long as you have a JVM to run it. Also things like Garbage Collector will help a lot in maintaining stability and prevent memory leaks. Even though Java is considered a mediocre language to program games in, it can still provide decent quality and performance (also personally Java is a language that I want to get better with).

## Game description
The idea of this game is to show the road of a player that has no idea in working with runes to complete rune mastery. He will be put into many dangerous situations and be attacked by various enemies so that he could learn how to become stronger and find his first rune, "Fehu".
It will be his first step on the long journey that awaits him.

## Some mechanics
Hugr (Old Norse: "thought","mind") is basically fragments of the fallen wannabe 
Runemasters, that left some of their soul power to help others that want to pursue the way of the Runemaster. But our hero should be cautious because the road will be steep and we need to look out for our fatigue to not get depleted.  

## Visuals
I've come to the conclusion that due to limited time I would go for a classic ASCII character game with implemented things like field of wiev(fog of war) so it may not look good but it does it job.
